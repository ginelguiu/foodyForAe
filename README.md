# foody
foody is an app designed for shopping, obviously, food. Before building the app, the following prerequisites need to be installed. After this is done, the app can be ran simpply from the IDE, since it's a Spring Boot app.

## Prerequisites

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
2. [Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.
   Depending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    yarn install

We use [Gulp][] as our build system. Install the Gulp command-line tool globally with:

    yarn global add gulp-cli

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./mvnw
    gulp

[Bower][] is used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [bower.json](bower.json). You can also run `bower update` and `bower install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `-h` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `bower update -h`.
